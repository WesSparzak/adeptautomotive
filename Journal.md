Starting my Journal a little late, but here we are.
Finally got GSAP to not bug out my website, it continued to give me "module not found" errors for each of the GSAP
modules even though I had correctly installed them. Turns out they were going to the wrong location, I had to manually
place them in the correct node_modules folder. Now it's time to learn how to use GSAP.
